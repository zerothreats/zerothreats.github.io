# All Cyber Security space Feilds


## Network Security

   * Protects computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks.
   * Focuses on firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and secure network protocols.

## Application Security

   * Ensures software and applications are secure during and after development.
   * Includes secure coding practices, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and patch management.

## Endpoint Security

   * Protects individual devices like computers, mobile phones, and IoT devices.
   * Common tools include antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, and mobile device management (MDM).

## Cloud Security

   * Secures data, applications, and services hosted in the cloud.
   * Focus areas include identity and access management (IAM), encryption, and compliance monitoring for cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.

## Data Security

   * Focuses on protecting data from unauthorized access, theft, or loss.
   * Includes encryption, data masking, data loss prevention (DLP), and secure storage.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

   * Ensures that only authorized individuals or systems can access resources.
   * Technologies include multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on (SSO), and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Operational Security (OpSec)

   * Involves procedures and policies to protect sensitive information.
   * Focuses on risk management, incident response, and security operations center (SOC) workflows.

## Critical Infrastructure Security

   * Protects systems critical to national security, such as energy grids, transportation, and water supply systems.
   * Includes industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) security.

## Incident Response and Forensics

   * Deals with detecting, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.
   * Includes log analysis, root cause identification, and digital forensics to investigate breaches.

## Penetration Testing and Red Teaming

   * Simulates attacks to find vulnerabilities before real attackers do.
   * Red teams emulate attackers, while blue teams focus on defending systems.

## Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

   * Ensures organizations meet legal, regulatory, and internal policy requirements.
   * Focuses on frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, and NIST.
## Threat Intelligence

   * Collects and analyzes data about potential threats to prevent attacks.
   * Includes monitoring dark web activities, malware analysis, and understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

## IoT and Embedded Security

   * Secures Internet of Things (IoT) devices and embedded systems.
   * Addresses challenges like device vulnerabilities, firmware security, and communication protocols.

## Physical Security

    * Protects the hardware and physical infrastructure from unauthorized access or damage.
    * Includes surveillance systems, access controls, and secure facility design.

## Cybersecurity Awareness and Training

    * Educates users and employees on recognizing and preventing cyber threats.
    Covers phishing awareness, safe browsing practices, and social engineering defenses.
